DN-4.0
Cognizant Hands-on Experience – Java Learning Tasks

This repository documents my hands-on Java practice tasks as part of the Cognizant DN 4.0 Program. These exercises focus on strengthening programming foundations through design principles, software patterns, and essential algorithmic problem-solving using Java.


Module 1 – Design Patterns and Principles

This module introduces object-oriented design principles and classic design patterns to build scalable, maintainable Java applications.

1. Singleton Pattern
File: Singleton.java

Definition: 
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Use Case:  
Used in configurations, logging, or database connection management to prevent multiple instances and reduce memory usage.




2. Factory Method Pattern
File: ShapeFactoryDemo.java

Definition: 
The Factory Method Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Use Case:
Useful when the exact types of objects to create are determined at runtime. Example: Drawing shapes like Circle, Square, etc.

Module 2 – Data Structures and Algorithms

This module contains practical implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms using Java for solving real-world problems.

1. E-commerce Platform – Product Search
File:ECommerceSearch.java

Definition:  
A simulation of a product search system using lists and filtering logic to mimic how basic search engines work in an e-commerce platform.

Use Case: 
Filters and displays products based on user-entered keywords, demonstrating linear search and list management.



2. Financial Forecasting
File:FinancialForecasting.java

Definition: 
A financial calculator that projects **revenue and profit over a time period** based on growth rate and profit margin.

Use Case:
Uses control structures and math functions to compute compound growth and summarize financial metrics year-wise.
